# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
I feel pretty good about it, I generally understand their uses and how to apply them, there are just some nuances where sometimes it doesn't act as I expected but I think thats something I have to learn as I go as I learn more methods.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
Yes - they totally make sense to me.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
The only thing that I can currently think of that confuses me a little bit is the implicit return of nil. Why is this a thing and why does it matter?
