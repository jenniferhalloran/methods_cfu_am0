# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The upcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; upcase has one clear job which is to capitalize all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "HI"
 "Hello World".upcase


p "Hello World".include?("Hello")


p "Hello World".end_with?("Hello")


p "Hello World".end_with?("rld")
